# 🧠 3-Month Learning Roadmap: Data Science + ML + DL + NLP

## 🔰 Month 1: **Core Python + Data Science Foundations**

### 🔹 Week 1: Python for Data Science

* Variables, lists, dicts, loops, functions, classes
* File I/O and exception handling

📚 Tools: `Jupyter Notebook`, `Google Colab`

### 🔹 Week 2: Data Analysis with Pandas & Numpy

* DataFrames, indexing, filtering
* Aggregation, missing values
* Numpy arrays, broadcasting

### 🔹 Week 3: Data Visualization + Math for DS

* Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly basics
* Stats: mean, median, variance, standard deviation
* Linear Algebra: vectors, matrices, dot product

### 🔹 Week 4: Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Handling nulls, duplicates
* Feature engineering basics
* Correlation, outliers, histograms, pairplots

📊 **Mini Project**: Analyze a dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)

## 🚀 Month 2: **Machine Learning (ML)**

### 🔹 Week 5: ML Theory + Scikit-Learn

* Supervised vs Unsupervised
* ML pipeline: loading → training → evaluating

### 🔹 Week 6: Regression + Classification

* Linear & Logistic Regression
* KNN, Decision Trees, Random Forests
* Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, F1, Confusion Matrix

### 🔹 Week 7: Unsupervised Learning

* K-Means Clustering
* Dimensionality Reduction (PCA)

📈 **Project Ideas**:

* Student Score Predictor (Regression)
* Iris Flower Classifier
* Customer Segmentation (Clustering)

### 🔹 Week 8: Model Optimization

* Train/Test split, Cross-validation
* Hyperparameter Tuning with GridSearchCV
* Overfitting, Regularization (L1/L2)

📚 Tools: `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`

---

## 🤖 Month 3: **Deep Learning + NLP Basics**

### 🔹 Week 9: Neural Networks (DL)

* Perceptron, activation functions
* Feedforward + Backpropagation
* Loss functions, optimizers (SGD, Adam)

📚 Tools: `TensorFlow`, `Keras`, `PyTorch (optional)`

### 🔹 Week 10: CNNs + Image Classification

* Conv2D, pooling, flattening
* Build your own image classifier (e.g., digit recognizer)

### 🔹 Week 11: NLP Basics

* Text preprocessing: tokenization, stopwords, stemming
* TF-IDF, BoW
* Sentiment Analysis with ML (Logistic, Naive Bayes)

📚 Tools: `NLTK`, `spaCy`, `scikit-learn`

### 🔹 Week 12: Transformers & Hugging Face (Intro)

* Overview of BERT, GPT
* Use pre-trained models with `transformers` lib
* Perform text classification or Q\&A with few lines of code

---

## 📁 Final Week (Bonus/Wrap-Up)

* Build 1 Capstone Project (ML or NLP based)
* Upload all your projects to GitHub
* Create a mini portfolio site or Notion/LinkedIn showcase
* Start applying for internships/entry-level roles
